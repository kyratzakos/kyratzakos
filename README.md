## Hi, I'm Apostolos 👋

I’m a software developer who spends way too much time wiring up APIs, wrestling with Mongo indexes, and automating anything that dares to be repetitive. When I’m not deep in TypeScript or Python, I’m cooking up side projects — from AI-powered travel apps to kart racing ones.

---

### 🔧 Toolbox of Choice
- TypeScript / JavaScript (my natural habitat)
- Python (for bots, data pipelines, and random experiments)
- MongoDB, 🟥 Redshift, 🐘 PostgreSQL
- AWS wizardry (Lambda, S3, EC2, IAM, Quicksight, etc.)
- Automation magic: Zapier, Pipedream, Retool, HubSpot APIs
- GitHub Actions (branch cleanup, release bots, Discord alerts)

---

### 🚀 Current Mode
- Building backend systems @ Wise Pelican that crunch 200M+ property records 📊
- Studying for my MSc in AI (Essex Uni) — exploring ML, fraud detection & AI adoption in finance 🤓
- Launching & breaking side projects faster than I can document them 🛠️

---

### 🎨 Side Quests
- Sightseer 🗺️ → Snap a landmark, get AI-generated descriptions (like Shazam, but for travel).
- Whale-Tracker 🐳 → Crypto whale bot that yells at me on Telegram when wallets move.
- Decepticode 🤖 → AI chatbot that helps recruiters with interviews.
- Random GitHub Actions ⚡ → Automating chores because life’s too short for manual release notes.

---

### 🏁 Fun Facts
- 🕹️ Building a text-based RPG in my spare time.
- 📸 Optimizing queries until they go from 🚶 to 🏎️.
- 🏎️ Will absolutely over-engineer a kart racing app just for fun.
- 📚 Have a bad habit of turning side projects into Notion roadmaps.

### 📫 Let’s Talk
- 🐙 Check my repos (spoiler: some are experiments, some are chaos).
- 🕶️ LinkedIn: Drop me a DM
- ✉️ Open to collabs if it’s fun, challenging, or a little bit absurd.
